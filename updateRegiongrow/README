update initial function and delete some useless argv

update the Region-grow initial algorithm
delete the hill-climp argv as it doesn't has any influence on partitioning

the Command line change
as I delete the argv hill-climp, so:

./tmp.exe cellfile netfile ubf pass_num init_

init_ now has three mod:
  0: random initial partition
  1: initial partition by the input order
  2: region grow algorithm 

eg: ./a.out ibm01.are ibm01.net 0.45 5 2

â€» Now the FM will achieve saturated in 5 pass
